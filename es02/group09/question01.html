In the U.S. things are different. The drafters of the U.S. constitution, haunted by fresh memories of religious intolerance in the Old World, were uncomfortable with the idea of governmental control of expression, whether political or religious. Thus, the First Amendment protects, among other types of expression, speech that might offend particular social groups.

<p>As it arises from the visualization the opinions tend to be at the opposite and not neutral. Moreover, most of the sites give definitions of Hate Speech that encourage to regulate the phenomenon by law. The most used source is Wikipedia, which stands out between all the others, and therefore it will be deeply analyzed in the next three protocols.</p>

<p>In this first visualization, our aim was to visualize what kind of sources—according to <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa Share of Voice tool</a>—the online users use to make themselves an opinion about Hate Speech, and how these sources could influence them.</p>

<p>On the x axis are displayed the seven categories of opinions in which we clustered the definitions that were given by all the sites we collected. Each opinion has a different color grading in order to better identify the different opinions and to help reading the graph. The y axis shows the six types of site sources.
The radius that defines the dimensions of the circles corresponds to the Network share level of the “Hate Speech” query, according to Alexa. As the mouse passes over the circles, it appears the precise definition of “Hate Speech” given by that source.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p><img src="/teaching-dd14/es02/group09/assets/images/protocols/protocol-01.png" /></p>

<p>We based this very first protocol on the classification made by <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a>, using the Share Of Voice tool. We queried “Hate Speech” and we manually scraped the data about all the sites that Alexa gave back, organizing them by ordered rows, which correspond to the position in the rank. Each site that resulted from Alexa was assigned to one of the six categories that we had defined: “Organizations/Association”, “News”, “Social Network/Media Company”, “Reference”, “University” and “Forum”.</p>

<p>At this point we decided to go even deeper, analyzing the various definitions of Hate Speech that were given by those sites. During the examination emerged seven different categories that sum up the main opinions about the debate: “Hate speech leads to hate crime”, “Hate speech is harmful and needs to be regulated”, “Hate speech must be fought with more speech”, “We still don’t know what hate speech is”, “Hate speech is hate speech only when it causes real reactions”, “Hate speech is free speech”, “Hate speech is a construct used to kill free speech”. The Excel file that resulted was uploaded on <a href="https://rawgraphs.io/" target="_blank">RawGraphs</a> in order to start displaying the data; the resulting SVG file was later refined with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
