                            The timeline, based on the data gained on Google Trend, compares the worldwide research interests on the most relevant online campaigns. All the values are counted in a scale from 0 to 100 as a relative proportion to the highest value that represent the biggest research frequency. We also used Google News to connect the spikes of the searches to their causative events.
