                The female biological clock in full hyperdrive. Firing all cylinders, she has a plan to get pregnant and you are not a part of it. Except to make 216 monthly payments which she plans to extort using any and all methods at her disposal. Including any form of deceit. There are virtually NO limits to what she is capable of – and WILL do – including reaching into the garbage to fertilize herself using the contents of a discarded condom which an otherwise responsibly-behaved man used to protect himself from entering fatherhood against his own will and better judgement.

                While women everywhere continue to publicly trip over themselves and stumble while trying to define a “man”, a “good man”, or (our personal favorite) a “real man”… as Men, we do not engage in that manner of horses~~~. It’s up to every woman to define herself. Women already do an excellent job of this with their actions, and particularly their non-actions.

                Bitch
            </h1>

            <p>

                Often mistaken for a derogatory term, the modern female embraces this title and wears it around her neck like Olympic Gold. This can be seen in modern literature written BY women – FOR other women – as in such books entitled ““Why Men Love Bitches” and “Why Men Marry Bitches”. Available in paperback on Amazon, at Borders bookstore(s), and wherever nauseating trash is sold. Therefore, women never get to complain when a man uses the word “bitch” in a sentence. This is precisely why so many millions of women are single against their own will and “can’t find a man”, and it explains the exploding population of single mothers. They deliberately cultivate disaster in their own personal lives, and will even advise other women to do the same. Literally. The only reason a Man would marry a bitch is because she worked her ass off to misrepresent herself for years. No man worth anything would ever do it knowingly. This has already been established here and that bitch also proudly wears the title like a badge of honor. Maintaining QUOTE: “All us bitches are the same. We’re all the same.”. Learn it.

                The small box or drawer a man uses to store items left behind by the women he sleeps with. When the bitch bin containing tooth brushes, hair brushes, hair ties, lipstick, etc. is found by his current interest, an unapologetic response by him heightens her attraction for him even more.

            </h1>

            <p>

                The Red Pill is a direct reference to a scene from the hugely successful 1999 film “The Matrix”, and symbolizes a preference for truth – no matter how painful it may be. The protagonist “Neo” (Keanu Reeves) is presented with a choice to continue living in the blue pill world that is pulled over his eyes to blind him from the truth, or to take the red pill with no other incentive offered – except the truth itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland…. and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Heavily inspired by Lewis C. Carroll’s novel “Alice in Wonderland” including direct reference to “the white rabbit”, Alice’s journey is about a girl who falls asleep and tumbles into an alternate and skewed reality by accident, and she awakes in her previous life. The Matrix story is the reverse. Neo (male) makes a conscious choice to journey to the real world and “wakes up” to discover his own stream of consciousness – ultimately realizing his full potential.

            </h1>

            <p>

                Coined by the rap artist E-40, “Captain Save-a-Ho” rescues women and single mothers who have made previously terrible choices. Playing the role of Prince Charming, he pays her bills, credit card debts, student loans, and pea-c~~~s himself as a “better man” for doing so, while allowing himself to be exploited as an ATM and human wallet. He may even take her kids to Disney Land, and “act like a father” not realizing he’s placing himself in a terribly precarious position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since no good deed goes unpunished, his “good deeds” turn to nightmares when the legal system decides he is now on the hook for another man’s spawn. If he doesn’t continue to play ATM, he can easily end up in prison for not paying child support for kids that aren’t even his.

            </h1>

            <p>

                The term “Cathedral” was coined by a Mr. M.M. and reformatted by Chateau Heartiste (and probably others) for a general audience to mean the collective motivations and enlivening spirit of the bulk of the human machinery that powers the entertainment, media, government and academia industrial complexes in the West, but particularly in America. This human machinery is mostly progressive in political disposition, equalist in ideology, tyrannical in method, snarky in execution, and hypocritical in principle.
            </p>
            <p>
                So as not to associate the meaning with any religious implication, the Cathedral may otherwise be referred to as the “hive” – to represent the reflexive, obedient, hive-like thinking on the subject of human intellectual, psychological and sex differences, both within and between groups.

            <p>

                Chad is to the SMP what rich kids are to the regular economy. You cant really understand SMP-dynamics without knowing Chad. He is the unmistakable archetypal bad boy, college jock/bully/douche. Often oblivious and purposely condescending or cruel to his fellow man. He has absolutely no clue about why whatever he does works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chad Thundercock is the subject of your study, and nothing more. Do not confuse him with the “alpha”. He is simply the embodiment of the phrase “No matter how good you are, theres always somebody better”. And “better” depends on circumstance, not facts or reason. Chad is the Boogeyman for most men in relationships, and the reality of the threat Chad represents is the fault of widespread female promiscuity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early examples include:

                • Stan in “Revenge of the Nerds”.
                • Glenn in “The Wedding Singer”.
                • Hardy Jenns in the John Hughes 80’s classic “Some Kind of Wonderful”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bad for her and she knows it, but doesn’t care. A Chad can impregnate her and leave, and her boyfriend / husband can raise him. She may be married but her husband is not her first choice. She will pine for her Chad on facebook as her relationship status is set to “ask me”.

In very recent years, “cuck” is now a widely used slur on social media platforms.

While smoking cigarettes may understandably be shunned and forbidden in public spaces, and even being extremely FIT is down voted and criticized…. being fat, unsightly and grossly unhealthy is embraced to a degree that can only be described as completely insane. Where the image on the left exposes the general consensus of the hive, the image on the right is pure satire.

                Frame (or re-frame)
            </h1>

            <p>

                Frame control is the sinew and gristle of inner “game”. The importance of owning the frame can’t be understated. It’s how the media gets you to believe their angle of the story, it’s how politicians demonize opponents and their constituents, it’s how academic shysters establish the bounds for acceptable debate, and it’s how experienced seducers communicate their higher status and unflappability to women.
            </p>
            <p>
                A frame is a system of interpretation that an individual or group uses to understand a certain event/situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are not framing/re-framing your conversations with women, you are leaving yourself vulnerable to hijacking by her hypergamous mating module. Power abhors a vacuum, and so does an undirected woman free to interpret anything you say in any way she sees fit. Framing a conversation in your favor is taking the initiative. Failure to control or at least massage her perception of you exposes you to unfavorable reinterpretations of your attractiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any conversation with a woman that is not explicitly framed by you to maximize your perceived status will lead to her forming a negative perception of your “value” over time. A PUA will make conscious efforts to maintain frame(and re-frame) for the explicit purpose of getting the bang.
            </p>
            <p>
                A MGHOW will effortlessly maintain frame whether it leads to sex or not. Her value perception of him is totally irrelevant. He need never study nor be aware, because her “perception” of him matters not.

            </h1>

            <p>

                The boundary in which a (typically) younger male is discarded by a female who do not wish to have sex with him . . . while still permitting him to lavish her in unearned attention, compliments, generosity and adoration. He may be an “orbiter” and provider without limits – but not a lover.
            </p>
            <p>
                The friendzone is time-sensitive, and once a man finds himself there, it is highly unlikely that he will be able to reverse her perception of him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where men look to qualify women, women look to DIS-qualify men.
                The friendzone is a deliberate disqualification – no matter how she colorizes it. ( Also see “LJBF” )
            </p>
            <p>
                It is widely acknowledged that women decide within the first 5 minutes of meeting a man whether or not sex will ever take place. This is the key period of time when she will attempt to “size him up” as quickly as possible in order to DIS-qualifty him as a mate and place him in the friendzone.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems counter-intuitive, but it is not important that she “likes” him. Too many many men make the mistake of trying to make her “like” him, rationalizing that this will lead to something more. This is patently false. It is also why women frequently make comments such “OMG I can’t believe I slept with that total JERK!”. Believe it, and take a cue from that. The “jerk” is not preoccupied with making her “like” him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Women are notoriously unaware of their own attraction mechanism, and will deny all of this until they are blue in the face. They will lie and mislead men – even unknowingly – to display female worshipping, weak, ass-kissing behavior . . . in order that she may DIS-qualifty him and move on to the next “jerk”. Women will actually give you the exact instructions of what NOT to do, so that they may toss you into the friendzone ASAP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never pay attention to what women say.
                ONLY pay attention to what they do.

                “Let’s just be friends”. Woman-speak for “I will not have sex with you”.
                It does not mean friendship under any circumstances.

            <p>
                The keyword in the phrase is “just”:

                “Let’s just be friends.”

            </p>
            <p>
                Use of this phrase proves women regard friendship as something of lower value than sex. It’s dismissive. As far as she is concerned, there are two kinds of men in the world: Men she will have sex with. And men she will not have sex with. The latter is “just” a friend.

MRAs seek to restore an equilibrium in the tragically skewed Western legal system where women have (and want) 100% “choice”, but fail to accept (and don’t want) 100% responsibility.

                A creature which lives in a woman’s brain, and feverishly spins the hamster wheel which helps her rationalize and justify her thoughts, behavior and actions regardless of how counterintuitive they may be. No amount of logic or reason can stop the hamster from spinning. Coined by the blogger Roissy. Her hamster will (for example) become apparent when she REFUSES to acknowledge the possibility that a man is simply not interested in her. She will convince herself “he’s a jerk” or “he must be gay” rather than accept the truth. The dialogue in her own head has no place in reality. The hamster also convinces “strong and independent” women who openly declare they “don’t need a man” (while simultaneously seeking one) that men are somehow “intimidated” by them . . . instead of accepting that she is best left to be “strong and independent” on her own for as long as possible.

                The hive/female definition of any male who is expected to make himself available to be treated as a utility, disposable tool, ATM machine, sperm donor or human wallet. Any man who refuses to be treated this way is generally regarded as “not a real man”, and should be prepared for an avalanche of shaming (i.e. “you must be prepared to drown on a sinking ship and ensure female comfort and convenience – even at the cost of your own life – else you are not a real man“). Most commonly used to describe any man who has not yet shackled himself to a female, or one who is seemingly immune and unaffected by her charms, looks or manipulations. This confuses the female to no end. So much so, that she will now attempt to convince herself that he is not even male.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the true definition of a “real man” is any human being born with XY chromosomes. The remainder of that definition is entirely up to him – and nobody else. Especially a woman, because she has zero concept or understanding of masculinity outside the scope of what she thinks he “should” do for her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even Caitlyn Jenner is still a “real man”. He’s just an artificial woman.

                The Red Pill is a direct reference to a scene from the hugely successful 1999 film “The Matrix”, and symbolizes a preference for truth – no matter how painful it may be. The protagonist “Neo” (Keanu Reeves) is presented with a choice to continue living in the blue pill world that is pulled over his eyes to blind him from the truth, or to take the red pill with no other incentive offered – except the truth itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland…. and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Heavily inspired by Lewis C. Carroll’s novel “Alice in Wonderland” including direct reference to “the white rabbit”, Alice’s journey is about a girl who falls asleep and tumbles into an alternate and skewed reality by accident, and she awakes in her previous life. The Matrix story is the reverse. Neo (male) makes a conscious choice to journey to the real world and “wakes up” to discover his own stream of consciousness – ultimately realizing his full potential.

            <p>

                Usually overheard in a sentence like “I want a relationship”, this is the silly female idea that some unmarried man (whom she often hasn’t even met) should be interested in not banging other chicks and paying for everything. She will automatically expect him to be sexually faithful, even when he is not married (and even when she refuses to put out) while conveniently forgetting exactly WHY he is not married. A scenario she pre-imagines in her head in which everything is done with HER best interest above all other things – while you are expected to fill a pre-conceived role of “provider” even when she has made zero effort to earn what she expects. Your needs, dreams and desires are a non-consideration and totally irrelevant, and everybody knows it. It is common for a female to expect such “commitment” and displays of costly devotion, while giving her affection away for free to someone else who is not remotely invested in her. Also known as a “relation~~~~”.

But even more importantly, where a young man may begin early adulthood with a very low SMV compared to an attractive young female, he will come to realize that he hasn’t even BEGUN to understand that as long as he remains diligent, patient, true to himself and rigorously focussed on more worthwhile pursuits…. his SMV is almost certainly going to increase exponentially over time. This can be understood by anyone with an iota of common sense, and is beautifully articulated by a man in this one of many examples.

                SpermJacking
            </h1>

            <p>

                The act of reaching into a garbage can to secretly extract the sperm from a discarded condom in an attempt to fertilize herself and extort 216 monthly payments from an otherwise responsibly-behaved man. All without his knowledge or consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guard your sperm like Fort Knox. There are no limits to what stunts a woman will pull with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom Leykis warns against sperm-jacking by recommending placing hot habanero sauce in the condom before discarding it to kill the sperm. This way, a slippery bitch will burn her own cooch instead of you. At least 4 cases are known where the woman attempted to bring charges against the man, but all were dropped because the condom (and sperm) were “his property”. One man received a settlement of $300K and phoned it in.

                The irreversible point a woman’s life where she can no longer get away with the same bad behavior she got away with when she was younger. The more attractive she is, the more profound and devastating the impact. For as film legend Lauren Bacall put it so eloquently: “every beautiful woman dies twice”.

                It’s not the years, it’s the mileage.
            </p>
            <p>
                A type of female shell shock (the thousand-yard stare of a soldier), the thousand c~~~ stare is dead-eyed, soulless, expressionless slutface in a delirium from having taken a few too many rides on the c~~~ carousel. Loosely defined as the look on a woman’s face that reveals spite, apathy, fatigue, and hopelessness all at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                See also any Kylie Jenner selfie, often matched with a throaty LiLo voice, while also sullen, withdrawn and joyless.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spite is because she is angry at the world for not having locked down a man because of her youthful indiscretions. The apathy is from being desensitized to sex. The fatigue is her being tired of the constant battle to get and keep male attention and having to resort to sexual favors earlier and earlier as she gets older. And the hopelessness comes from her knowing deep down she’ll never have a relationship of consequence with a man she loves and respects, who finds her tolerable outside of sex.

            <p>

                The “Traditional Conservative” is an individual (or group) that advocates on behalf of cultural values and sex roles that previously existed and may have once worked. Traditionalists believe that tradition and custom guide man and his worldview. Classical Conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, tradition, hierarchy and organic unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                MGTOW have a strong moral compass and are not automatic staunch critics of tradcon values. For example, it’s easy to agree children should be properly raised by two (male and female) parents…. but outdated concepts like “men go down with the ship” and declarations like “real men should ______ “ are wildly archaic in an era where “gender equality” is rammed down everyone’s throats.
            </p>
            <p>
                MGTOW are also fully aware that traditional relationships & marriage have evolved to nothing but an anti-male business as a bottom line – shoving fathers and husbands out of their own families, homes, futures and fortunes. So a preacher of tradcon values can expect to get an earful within the current social and legal climate.

            </h1>

            <p>

                Any man who believes the sun rises and sets based solely on female approval. He gives a woman complete access to his resources without first securing proof of that woman’s willingness to provide ongoing sexual resources – regardless of how frequently or infrequently he engages in such behavior. A White Knight will fall over himself for female attention, affection and approval with ridiculous displays of “chivalry”, and will even make an offer to purchase her attention with a meal, favors, or even engage in male-bashing behavior. Having enough low self-esteem to think of his very life as disposable for female comfort and convenience, he believes he is “better” than other men who simply don’t LOWER themselves (or compromise their virtues) while kneeling for female validation and acceptance.

            </h1>

            <p>

                Contrary to popular opinion and common misconceptions, a “whore” is not a woman who engages in promiscuous sex openly and freely. She does NOT have sex…. until (or unless) she gets something ELSE.

            </p>
            <p>

                A whore deliberately withholds her affection and attention until some other unrelated price is paid or condition is met first. However, she can only be open for business for as long as she can convince a man that he wants (and needs) sex more than she does. As far as every whore is concerned, sex is something YOU should pay for, but not good enough for her to receive as a fair exchange. When a man figures out women are far more sexual than men – and she can’t pull this off anymore – her price plummets, and she gets furious.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every woman who has withheld sex until some unrelated price has been paid (or condition is met) is a whore, and for many thousands of years, men have been willing to support whores since the beginning of time while having no problem with this mutual arrangement. However, the modern whore operates under false pretenses while pretending she is not
            </p>
            <p>
                a whore. She will dress, behave, negotiate and even make efforts to look like one, while masking her motivations and rigorously denying she is a prostitute at all. And that’s a whore of a different color.

<p>Among the results of the Hyperbolic Tree of the seventh protocol the MGTOW appeared more than once: in the subreddit and as a independent blog. It was decided for this reason to analyze specifically the MGTOW website. The specific <strong>verbal language</strong> of the website was gathered inside a glossary that was used to create a heatmap representing the use’s frequency of the words inside the forum’s sections.
It’s possible to notice that the most used words are the ones pertinent to their category. For example “MRA” (Men’s Rights Activist) is the most frequent one in the “man’s and father’s right” category and “husbank” (a husband who’s only expected purpose is to allow himself to be treated like a bank machine) is one of the most representative of the “money” section.</p>

<p><strong>Furthermore insults and ironic offensive words are very common</strong>: in the Philosophy forum section the most used word is “slut” while words like “fat acceptance” and “land whale” (an extremely obese woman) are the more representative for the “health and fitness” category. By clicking on one word a box pops up and leads to its definition. The tag cloud above the heat map represents the 25 most representative words of the MGTOW’s glossary over the whole forum.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p><img src="/teaching-dd14/es02/group01/assets/images/protocols/protocol-08.svg" alt="example of protocol" /></p>

<p>We explored the website of the most relevant manosphere community: Men Going Their Own Way. Looking into the website we noticed the presence of a glossary section containing mostly insults and neologisms created by the community members. So, in order to visualize the spreadability of the words inside the website, we exploit Google Search to identify 
the comments of the threads in the MGTOW’s forums and counted the number of glossary’s words inside each of them.</p>
