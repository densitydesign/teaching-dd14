I.e reducing 27C to 19C instead of reducing 22C to 19C is a pretty huge cost saving exercise. Yes, there is an issue of humidity (depending on where the DC is, so this may not be a viable option). In winter, it boggles the mind that air conditioners continuously work 24/7/365 when there is sufficient cold air outside. Finding a way to use the cold outside air with no humidity is the ultimate goal to reduce cooling costs to maybe 1/5th of their current usage (maybe more?).

You have to understand that while many things in life produce energy, wind, heat, light, chemical reactions, steam, natural gas, nuclear fission, fossil fuel burning, even friction, That energy isn't instantly transferable to usable power that you can plug devices into. Power must be consistent and within a certain amperage and voltage to not overload devices. This is why electricity that goes to your home goes through a couple of transformers. A big one that reduces voltage from hundreds of thousands of volts to just thousands of volts. Then another one closer to your home which converts the voltage in the power lines to a more managable amount to the wires that go into your home and a final transformer usually near your house which reduces the voltage to what you get at your house outlet 110-120 volts. So back to your statement about heat exhaust powering LEDs, assuming you want those LEDs to be on all the the time (and not be powering other things as well) you're talking about kilowatt-hour levels of power not the few watts of power you'd be able to get from trapping the heat from a server farm.": {

      "+mage davee¬†+SciShow What? Ok, first of all, 5 years working in IT + physics post-grad¬†= generally zero knowledge of chip construction. Almost nobody in the IT industry knows anything about chip construction or operation, and your physics education will teach you little or nothing about the real-world issues involved with operating this technology. Meanwhile, since apparently this is now a dick-waving contest, I'll see your 5 years of IT experience, and¬†raise you my 10 years of IT experience working for Microsoft, most of which has been work for Microsoft Azure (where we actually deal with these very issues every day), as well as several years of work for Microsoft as a business intelligence analyst - the person who¬†reviews actual costs, benefits, and risks involved with¬†different solutions, and MAKES the decisions to maximize profits regardless what some IT folks may think makes the best sense physically or technologically. No, the people paying the bills do not listen to their IT folks while ignoring their business intelligence - not if they want to stay in business, anyway. Real senior IT¬†professionals advocate solutions they've seen with their own eyes and experienced for themselves, rather than¬†some blurb¬†from Intel they read in a random article from Energy Star. The fact that you think reading source articles is necessary before jumping into an IT conversation demonstrates that you have a long way to go professionally. I wouldn't have made the comments I've made, if my personal experience didn't support my position strongly. This part of the Energy Star temperature article caught my attention: \"In August 2008, Intel conducted a 10-month study to assess the effectiveness of using only outside air to cool a data center. The temperature range was 64¬∞F to 92¬∞F. Humidity varied from 4% to over 90% and changed rapidly at times. No increase in server failure was observed.\" There is a major problem with this study by Intel -¬†it's¬†only a 10-month study, which is far too short to base business decisions on, since it doesn't encompass the real potential¬†average lifespan of relevant enterprise hardware. Since this study is the major, central source for the higher temperature ideas, the problems with the original study¬†significantly damage the credibility of Hank's source material for this claim. If they could conduct this study for a 5-year period, and STILL have no measurable increase in server failure, THAT would be enough to persuade me that raising the temperature could potentially be financially beneficial (assuming they ran the test datacenter in a manner consistent with real-world datacenter scenarios). You can think of this¬†kinda¬†like how scientific experiment results aren't considered viable until they¬†reach e.g. six-sigma in terms of the consistency and repeatability of¬†the results. But I doubt we'll ever¬†see the results of¬†such an exhaustive¬†study, because the potential benefit we could gain from the data simply isn't worth the cost of executing such a study, in the eyes of many executives. Datacenters will never be free of corporate politics, unfortunately. Another thing to bear in mind is, with thousands of dollars saved in energy costs every year by raising the temperature, it only takes a few extra server failures to lose that amount of¬†money again. Very little stands to be gained unless it can be irrefutably demonstrated that higher temperatures have absolutely no negative impact whatsoever over very long periods of time with real-world datacenter operation and usage scenarios. Otherwise, a few thousand dollars is not enough of a financial incentive for a datacenter that costs millions of dollars to operate, to risk losing much more money by experimenting with an idea that isn't fully tested in long-term real-world datacenter scenarios. Datacenter A/C bills might¬†seem high, but I guarantee they use far more energy to power the servers themselves than they use to power the A/C - making the potential savings nothing more than a tiny sliver of a percentage of the datacenter's¬†overall¬†energy consumption. So how about before you¬†belittle other people's¬†IT expertise, make sure they aren't twice as¬†experienced as you are in the first place, make sure the stuff you are reading in the doobleedoo is actually irrefutable, and ask yourself whether you¬†could realistically,¬†successfully make the case for your opinion to a corporate executive without them laughing at how little you understand about business intelligence and corporate politics. SciShow raising awareness of this¬†Intel study¬†via¬†YouTube will probably result in a bunch of junior IT engineers running to their bosses with really stupid ideas, after which their bosses will smack them upside the head for being so reckless and oblivious.": {

It's literally a waste of time to even consider this crap. There's nothing to be gained. - I whisked it away by saying it is not accurate, AND explained exactly why the study¬†does not¬†demonstrate legitimate real-world benefits for datacenters¬†as a result¬†of increasing the air temperature. - The only source I showed, is also the only source available - since, again, nobody is interested in pursuing this¬†because there's no payoff. And¬†the study¬†doesn't contradict my claim because the study itself is not viable/credible, due to the issues I described in detail. A bad study is a bad study, and I don't need to go any farther than that.

Germans currently get 6% of their electricity from solar. \"Solar is greenwash bullshit that is backed by oil companies.\" Actually, the energy companies are absolutely terrified of solar because (in many places) it has the potential to remove millions of customers from the grid completely. \"That's right, natural gas.\" Or, hmmm.... I don't know, batteries? \"Also I do know what I am talking about, I work in the industry.\" I know, you have exactly the same scripted responses as all of the other energy company shills that I've encountered on the web. \"Nuclear is the only reliable option other than oil and gas.\" Maybe so, but shitting all over solar isn't going to get nuclear power plants built.
