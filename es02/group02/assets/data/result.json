I.e reducing 27C to 19C instead of reducing 22C to 19C is a pretty huge cost saving exercise. Yes, there is an issue of humidity (depending on where the DC is, so this may not be a viable option). In winter, it boggles the mind that air conditioners continuously work 24/7/365 when there is sufficient cold air outside. Finding a way to use the cold outside air with no humidity is the ultimate goal to reduce cooling costs to maybe 1/5th of their current usage (maybe more?).

You have to understand that while many things in life produce energy, wind, heat, light, chemical reactions, steam, natural gas, nuclear fission, fossil fuel burning, even friction, That energy isn't instantly transferable to usable power that you can plug devices into. Power must be consistent and within a certain amperage and voltage to not overload devices. This is why electricity that goes to your home goes through a couple of transformers. A big one that reduces voltage from hundreds of thousands of volts to just thousands of volts. Then another one closer to your home which converts the voltage in the power lines to a more managable amount to the wires that go into your home and a final transformer usually near your house which reduces the voltage to what you get at your house outlet 110-120 volts. So back to your statement about heat exhaust powering LEDs, assuming you want those LEDs to be on all the the time (and not be powering other things as well) you're talking about kilowatt-hour levels of power not the few watts of power you'd be able to get from trapping the heat from a server farm.": {

      "+mage davee +SciShow What? Ok, first of all, 5 years working in IT + physics post-grad = generally zero knowledge of chip construction. Almost nobody in the IT industry knows anything about chip construction or operation, and your physics education will teach you little or nothing about the real-world issues involved with operating this technology. Meanwhile, since apparently this is now a dick-waving contest, I'll see your 5 years of IT experience, and raise you my 10 years of IT experience working for Microsoft, most of which has been work for Microsoft Azure (where we actually deal with these very issues every day), as well as several years of work for Microsoft as a business intelligence analyst - the person who reviews actual costs, benefits, and risks involved with different solutions, and MAKES the decisions to maximize profits regardless what some IT folks may think makes the best sense physically or technologically. No, the people paying the bills do not listen to their IT folks while ignoring their business intelligence - not if they want to stay in business, anyway. Real senior IT professionals advocate solutions they've seen with their own eyes and experienced for themselves, rather than some blurb from Intel they read in a random article from Energy Star. The fact that you think reading source articles is necessary before jumping into an IT conversation demonstrates that you have a long way to go professionally. I wouldn't have made the comments I've made, if my personal experience didn't support my position strongly. This part of the Energy Star temperature article caught my attention: \"In August 2008, Intel conducted a 10-month study to assess the effectiveness of using only outside air to cool a data center. The temperature range was 64°F to 92°F. Humidity varied from 4% to over 90% and changed rapidly at times. No increase in server failure was observed.\" There is a major problem with this study by Intel - it's only a 10-month study, which is far too short to base business decisions on, since it doesn't encompass the real potential average lifespan of relevant enterprise hardware. Since this study is the major, central source for the higher temperature ideas, the problems with the original study significantly damage the credibility of Hank's source material for this claim. If they could conduct this study for a 5-year period, and STILL have no measurable increase in server failure, THAT would be enough to persuade me that raising the temperature could potentially be financially beneficial (assuming they ran the test datacenter in a manner consistent with real-world datacenter scenarios). You can think of this kinda like how scientific experiment results aren't considered viable until they reach e.g. six-sigma in terms of the consistency and repeatability of the results. But I doubt we'll ever see the results of such an exhaustive study, because the potential benefit we could gain from the data simply isn't worth the cost of executing such a study, in the eyes of many executives. Datacenters will never be free of corporate politics, unfortunately. Another thing to bear in mind is, with thousands of dollars saved in energy costs every year by raising the temperature, it only takes a few extra server failures to lose that amount of money again. Very little stands to be gained unless it can be irrefutably demonstrated that higher temperatures have absolutely no negative impact whatsoever over very long periods of time with real-world datacenter operation and usage scenarios. Otherwise, a few thousand dollars is not enough of a financial incentive for a datacenter that costs millions of dollars to operate, to risk losing much more money by experimenting with an idea that isn't fully tested in long-term real-world datacenter scenarios. Datacenter A/C bills might seem high, but I guarantee they use far more energy to power the servers themselves than they use to power the A/C - making the potential savings nothing more than a tiny sliver of a percentage of the datacenter's overall energy consumption. So how about before you belittle other people's IT expertise, make sure they aren't twice as experienced as you are in the first place, make sure the stuff you are reading in the doobleedoo is actually irrefutable, and ask yourself whether you could realistically, successfully make the case for your opinion to a corporate executive without them laughing at how little you understand about business intelligence and corporate politics.

The only source you showed contradicts your claim, and yet you whisk it away by saying it is not accurate and yet not explaining further\" I addressed all of these issues directly, but perhaps you skimmed over it a little too quickly, so I'll reiterate for you: - There are no existing \"facts\" to back me up, because the industry agrees the benefits do not outweigh the costs of conducting a proper, viable, credible study to confirm my claims. It's literally a waste of time to even consider this crap. There's nothing to be gained. - I whisked it away by saying it is not accurate, AND explained exactly why the study does not demonstrate legitimate real-world benefits for datacenters as a result of increasing the air temperature. - The only source I showed, is also the only source available - since, again, nobody is interested in pursuing this because there's no payoff. And the study doesn't contradict my claim because the study itself is not viable/credible, due to the issues I described in detail. A bad study is a bad study, and I don't need to go any farther than that. If a GOOD study exists that contradicts me, show it to me and I'll admit my errors right then and there. - The study is from 7 years ago, so I guarantee I would have heard about it in the course of my work, rather than from SciShow, if the study was viable/credible. After all, what corporation is going to ignore information that could save them money, especially when it comes from an industry leader such as Intel. \"pretty sure physics is far more experience than your cute little 'IT' job.\" Physics education is great, but generally irrelevant to IT operations. Physics education is useful in nanotechnology design for computer chips, but that's a rare specialty for a physicist, and I doubt +mage davee is a specialist in this area. I'm an independent contract consultant for Microsoft, which means I get a new job at Microsoft every 6-36 months or so. Here are a few of the \"cute little 'IT' jobs\" I've had over the years, in no particular order: - Senior Software Development Engineer - Software Architect (current) - Business Intelligence Analyst - Service Operations Engineer - Service Operations Program Manager With the variety of experience I have, working in respectable positions at an industry leading IT/Software company (again, largely working for Microsoft Azure), I do have the real-world experience to hold my weight in these types of discussions. You're welcome to disagree with the legitimacy of my industry experience, but your blatant ignorance of this industry will be laughed at by every senior manager who has interviewed me for these positions, as well as every senior Microsoft executive who would personally read my daily intelligence reports to help make large-scale business decisions to maximize the profitability of the products and services involved. Bottom line: Hank's sources for this video are multiple IT \"generations\" old, and none of this is new information - e.g. zombie servers, hot/cold aisles, etc. All of these practices are already in use pretty much everywhere, as of multiple years ago - and you can rest assured there are entire groups of program managers and business intelligence analysts who are managing simple issues like zombie servers every single day. As for raising the air temperature, nobody will do it because it is not a smart decision, no matter how you look at it.

      "\"There you go. That is why it works for you. Up here in Canada, solar is completely useless.\" Then you need to qualify that, instead of spouting a bunch of ignorant nonsense. Just because it doesn't work for you, that doesn't mean that it can't work for tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of people. \"It is also useless in Europe (especially the UK) and Asia.\" It may not make financial sense in Europe, but it does work there. Germans currently get 6% of their electricity from solar. \"Solar is greenwash bullshit that is backed by oil companies.\" Actually, the energy companies are absolutely terrified of solar because (in many places) it has the potential to remove millions of customers from the grid completely. \"That's right, natural gas.\" Or, hmmm.... I don't know, batteries? \"Also I do know what I am talking about, I work in the industry.\" I know, you have exactly the same scripted responses as all of the other energy company shills that I've encountered on the web. \"Nuclear is the only reliable option other than oil and gas.\" Maybe so, but shitting all over solar isn't going to get nuclear power plants built. The only reason you have to spread your lies about solar is because of the fact that it's a huge threat to the energy industry.  \"If solar was so great, we would already be using it globally\" Your feigned ignorance wont fly here. You know as well as anyone does how much power energy companies hold over the market. The great thing about solar is that it's such a vastly superior technology that there will simply be no way to keep people from adopting it en masse, now that all the bugs have been worked out.  \"The only other truly reliable green energy is geothermal. It works great in countries like Iceland\" It works there because of their geographical location, it can't just be deployed successfully anywhere..": {
