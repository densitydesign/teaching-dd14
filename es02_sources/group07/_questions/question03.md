### Description
The visualisation describes how Google ranked the first 25 links for the queries "Belo Monte Dam" and "Usina Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte." Between the query in English and the one in Portuguese, there is a noticeable difference in the website categories. While News are the most recurring for both queries, Environmental Organisations and Human Rights Organisations websites are ranking higher in the English search, and way more recurring. On the other hand, the Brazilian ranking is more heterogeneous, with a wider variety of websites more evenly scattered from top to bottom. In particular, the category of Companies is distinctive of the Brazilian query.  

Overall, it is noticeable that international websites are gathered around akin point of views, while Brazilian websites are presenting the topic from a widest range of perspectives involved in the debate.



### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocol_3.svg' | relative_url }})

As Belo Monte resulted in being one of the highest ranking pages in the previous protocol, it was decided to investigate the debate both from the international and local perspective, by accessing both English and Brazilian sources. In order to do that, we queried Google using as keywords the titles of the Wikipedia pages of Belo Monte in English (“Belo Monte Dam”) and Portuguese (“Usina Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte”). Google.com in English language was used for the English search, while Google.br in Brazilian Portuguese was used for the Portuguese search. The searches were done on Firefox in private mode. The output was a list of the first 50 links of each search as of 9th November 2018.The output of this search was used to conduct nearly all of this phase of the research. For this protocol, we considered the first 25 results of both queries. The resulting websites were firstly categorised according to their provenience (Brazilian and international) and then to their type. The 7 categories created were used to describe both Brazilian and international websites. The categories (News, Educational and Academic, Companies, Social Media and Publishing Platforms, Environmental Organisations, Human Rights Organisations, Governmental Institutions) would be also used in later protocols. The visualisation was created manually with Adobe Illustrator.
