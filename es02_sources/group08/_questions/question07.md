To deliver this protocol, Twitter has been selected as the most suitable platform to fit the question. 12 amongst companies and national agencies have been selected, considering the mentioned actors in previous protocols. A very first manual scraping has been made to get the number of tweets, the following and the follower profiles. For what concerns the tools, Twint and Python have been combined to extract tweet contents in text format considering a bimestral time range, starting from September 20th. The .txt files have been manually scraped to spot entities and personalities tagged in tweets.
All the results have been organized by columns in an Excel folder in order to match company, account link, tweet counter, following, followers, and the frequency cited ID. 
This last column matches reciprocal mentions and tags for each actor considered.
