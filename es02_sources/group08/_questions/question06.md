### Description
This network shows the related topics in high rated scientific press. The white bullets displays research fields as sorted by the Web Of Science. As the platform reported many peculiar categories
the visualization displayed 20 main scientific domains, which embodies the respective subcategories. Coloured bullets represent the most relevant scientific papers published, while different colours display world regions matching the location of universities and research centers providing studies. What emerges is that most flourishing research field are engineering and aerospace. These categories are separated as engineering includes different disciplines, such as mechanical, nuclear and energetic. While aerospace includes all the research fields generating projects strictly concerning spaceflight innovation. It’s interesting to see how many papers share these two domains. That could be meaningful if we compare this with news results reporting new achievements in spaceflight launches and technology. It follows the medical sciences domain, with papers dealing with human health in space.

### Protocol
<img class="protocolli" src="{{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocol-6.png' | relative_url }}"/>

To deliver this protocol, we addressed the Web Of Science. This news collector has been a powerful tool, to explore scientific papers released in official press.
The platform has been searched as active member of the Italian University System. The advanced search tool in the platform has been used to select results pertinent to the queries, as seen in previous protocols: space colonization and space exploration. The timeframe related to the results include all the scientific papers published within’ 2018: the advanced search has been set to display results from January 2018 to February 2018, sorted by relevance. 1400 results were found for space exploration query while 200 results were found for space colonization query. Many results use these keywords related to same concepts, but focused on very different scientific domains, such as microbiology, nanosciences, immunology and virology. A manual scraping has been made so, analyzing the abstracts to filter only pertinent results. The final selection takes into account 15 papers for space colonization and 85 papers for space exploration. All the results have been organized by columns in an Excel folder, in order to match Research field, Web Of Science Category, Paper Titles, Press Organizations, Authors and Universities/Research Centers mentioned.
