### Description
Among the results of the Hyperbolic Tree of the seventh protocol the MGTOW appeared more than once: in the subreddit and as a independent blog. It was decided for this reason to analyze specifically the MGTOW website. The specific **verbal language** of the website was gathered inside a glossary that was used to create a heatmap representing the use’s frequency of the words inside the forum’s sections.
It’s possible to notice that the most used words are the ones pertinent to their category. For example “MRA” (Men’s Rights Activist) is the most frequent one in the “man’s and father’s right” category and “husbank” (a husband who’s only expected purpose is to allow himself to be treated like a bank machine) is one of the most representative of the “money” section.

**Furthermore insults and ironic offensive words are very common**: in the Philosophy forum section the most used word is “slut” while words like “fat acceptance” and “land whale” (an extremely obese woman) are the more representative for the “health and fitness” category. By clicking on one word a box pops up and leads to its definition. The tag cloud above the heat map represents the 25 most representative words of the MGTOW’s glossary over the whole forum.

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-08.svg' | relative_url }})

We explored the website of the most relevant manosphere community: Men Going Their Own Way. Looking into the website we noticed the presence of a glossary section containing mostly insults and neologisms created by the community members. So, in order to visualize the spreadability of the words inside the website, we exploit Google Search to identify 
the comments of the threads in the MGTOW’s forums and counted the number of glossary’s words inside each of them.
