### Description
The second protocol reveals that the biggest category of sources talking about feminism are newspapers. For this reason we decided to explore more deeply this topic using the range of years (2012-Today) indicated by the fourth-wave feminism explored in the third protocol. The streamgraph’s aim is to show the **involvement of newspaper sources** appearing on Google News from the start of the fourth-wave feminism (2012) until today.

The first part of the visualization is a streamgraph, whose aim is to visualize how the sources treat the theme during the years, how much the theme is exploited by the news and if there is a provider that, more than the others, could be identified as the most involved in the topic. It is clear that the biggest number of articles was published in 2013, year in which the controversies around feminism started to spread around media and social networks, followed by 2018, the year that witnessed the rising of MeToo. It’s evident that The Guardian is the most involved source in the topic since 2013 with 37 articles published confirming leadership over time.

The second graph represents the different **categories of images** pushed to the mainstream by newspapers for each year. What is interesting to notice is that the larger category is **“stakeholders and celebrities”** with 351 image. The hegemony of this category on the others led us to investigate who are the main personalities involved in feminism in the next protocol.

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-04.svg' | relative_url }})

We used the word “feminism” as a query for our Google News research. We collected all the sources of the news, the date and the preview images of all the articles from 2012 until today. While for the first visualization we used only online sources with more than 10 articles obtaining 15 newspapers, for the visualization of the images we used all the results getting a corpus of 708 images that were distributed in different categories over the years.
