### Description
In academic field, the second question we want to ask is how these 40 papers are referenced to each other in different areas? (Do they cite the same references? Is there any connection between Baidu scholar and Google scholar?)

The visualization composes of 40 academic papers and their references. The 40 dots in circle represent the 40 search results we gain from the websites as the selected sample to answer the research question. 20 papers from Baidu Scholar are in the upper part and the other 20 from Google Scholar are in the opposite. In the center lie two lines of dots refer to the common references in two websites, and on the periphery there are lines related to the other references that are cited by only one paper. 

We find it interesting that there are many references in common cited by the papers in Baidu Scholar whereas very few common references are found among Google results. In addition, whether it is reference or paper, there is no any connection between Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar.


### Protocol

![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/Q5.png' | relative_url }})

To analyze the references and to see if and how they link each other and if there are recurring quoted authors and which are the main actors we firstly extracted them from the 40 academic papers. 

The different papers structures do not allow to use a tool for automate this process, so the dataset has been created manually:

-In the Chinese part, we found that most of the references are published by University affiliations and we reorganized the data by it and then found the common references.
-In the English part, we found that very few information is in common, so we used the search function in Excel and found several papers in common. 

We also noticed that there's no common reference between English papers and Chinese papers, and visualized it manually in Illustrator.
