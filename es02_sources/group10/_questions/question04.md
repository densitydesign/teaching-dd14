### Description
Continuing with what we have found in the last question that none of results in academic area are from Baidu, we wanted to explore deeper into this field.    

Thus, the first question we wanted to ask is what keywords appear more times in the papers about Malaysian Chinese if we look in not only in Google but also in Baidu to see if there is any connection between the results from two acdemic sites. In order to know it, we searched 20 papers in Baidu Scholar and 20 papers in Google Scholar with “Malaysian Chinese” and collected the keywords of each paper.

We chose pie chart to visualize the data. The number of keywords in papers from google acdemic is 61, and that from Baidu is 90. The circles in 2 colors refer to common keywords that appear in papers from both two acdemic sites. The size of circle refers to the number of the times that each keyword appears in papers . 

We found out that the keywords appear in both acdemic sites are mainly related to ethnic groups like: Malaysian Chinese, Chinese,Malays. Meanwhile, we can also see that keywords about identity and culture are used by scholars in both acdemic sites. Besides, we noticed that keywords from google scholar are more separated in topics, while keywords from baidu scholar are more foucused on ethic relations.


### Protocol

![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/Q4.png' | relative_url }})

This section is focused on "how 'Malaysian Chinese' is mentioned in academic area". We started from Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar with the query "Malaysian Chinese", "马来西亚华人". For each query the first 20 papers were considered, so 40 results in total. Then we translated the Chinese keywords into English and made them into one visualization.
The papers were downloaded, analyzed and tagged. The main dataset is composed by: id, link, title of the paper, author/s, information about the authors (job, studies, nationality and university), topic. After we organized the dataset in Excel we made the visualization in RawGraphs.
