The first source of the information is mainly from the website Subzin, in which it's possible to find out all those films, whose subtitles contain the researched query. It's achievable to obtain a complete list of the movies which contained all kinds of types of movies. 

We started with the query of “Malaysia Chinese”, but few movies mentioned these two words, so we search Malaysian Chinese movies in Google video and gained 60(21 results are related) movies. (23 results in total)
After we took the 64 screenshots with “Malaysian Chinese” in the subtitle in these 23 movies, we gathered the information on IMDb.com such as 
-the name of movies
-the genre 
-year produced
-the rating
-the type of movies 
We also manually tagged in the 64 screenshots with:
-the activities
-the age
-the number of keywords mentioned

Then we made the visualization in Illustrator.
