### Description
The visualization is focused on the development and the relations between Mexican avocado cartels during the years, and the relevance of every cartel to avocado, based on a Google research, is defined. The central element is a timeline divided in two main parts: the lines represent each cartel evolution, and the colored areas are proportioned to show the link of every cartel to the avocado.
In particular, it is possible to note that the most recent cartels, the CJNG and Los Caballeros Templarios, are the most mentioned ones for the illegal avocado trade. Details of their development are also reported.


### Protocol

![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocols_p6.svg' | relative_url }})

We used the data from the previous protocol to identify which criminal cartels trade avocado in Mexico. In order to know more about the cartel, we relied to InsightCrime, a website that investigates and analyzes organized crime in Latin America and Caribbean. Inside the website we searched for all the cartels name emerged from protocol 5 (query:”cartel name”) and looked at the years in which that cartel developed, along with eventual mentions of other cartels, defining and setting the information in a timeline. A further research, done by setting “aguacate+name of the cartel” allowed us to find out how many times every cartel was mentioned along with avocado by Google results. To achieve this, we considered the total amount of results indicated by Google; we designed each area in a proportional way, sizing them as wider as many results we had for the cartel.

The dataset is an enriched version of the previous one. It contains a list of the mexican criminal cartels, each one paired with the most important dates in their development. In the third column, the cartels’ relevance to avocado trade is reported: it represents the number of times the cartel is mentioned along with avocado in the news for each year.
