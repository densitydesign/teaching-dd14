### Description
To get a deeper insight on the online press around avocado issues, the visualization shows the providers of the news in the previous graph; the aim is to understand better who are the providers sharing about avocado issues, what is their importance and how much do they usually spread. The main outcome desired was a better understanding of the online ‘places’ where people get information about our topic.

In particular, working once more on USA and Mexico, the results are pretty different. The list of providers for both countries was obtained identifying the news resulted from visualization 3, using just 2018 data to stay adherent to the current situation. An analysis was conducted, categorizing the providers by nature (kind of media), geographical origin and relevance of avocado-related corpus of references.

For USA, it is interesting to note that the main providers talking about the avocado market are two food industry focused platforms, [Fresh-Plaza](https://www.freshplaza.com/), and [The Packer](https://www.thepacker.com/), as they published the biggest number of references to the query ‘avocado trade’ in 2018, according to our in-site google search. Minor sources include several USA newspaper websites, such as [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), but it is remarkable the presence of The Yucatan Times, a Mexican daily newspaper, some Californian provider and some other international sources (Kenya, China).
The Mexican situation appears quite different: the main news provider on the topic are newspapers and broadcasting agency websites. The Mexican TV company [Noticieros](https://noticieros.televisa.com/) is the provider with the biggest number of mention for ‘aguacate traffic’ in 2018 but is followed by some local, national and international online newspaper. Michoacan ones play an important role, while the international sources are from Latino America and Spain, but is interesting the presence of a Californian provider.­

The visualization associates the different categories to the importance of the providers, highlighting the differences between them with a color-coded treemap.

### Protocol

Starting from the providers of the news in visualization 3, the protocol is aimed to analyze and classifies them. The investigation around the nature of the website and the origin was conducted on Google search, about the About page of each website, for USA and Mexico; the relevance definition follows a different path. Using the VPN settings to define localization, we conducted an in-site Google Search for the queries ‘avocado+trade’ and ‘aguacate+trafico,’ considering the results as in index of the relevance of the provider in the avocado-news field. The data was collected for both countries and displayed in a treemap.

### Data

Starting from the information obtained from visualization 3 and considering the last year only (2017-2018), we listed data by news’ relevance, origin and nature. In order to do that, we manually scraped information from the secondary queries used in the protocol: first, setting the “site” operator on Google, we searched for the number of “avocado” mentions in every news providers’ websites; the news providers origin has been defined.
