00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
–&nbsp;So when you think about say in a atheistic framework, atheist professor and scientist, colleagues right,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.680
when they walk into a laboratory they have a particular framework of the world.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.600
They believe the world is random… – They do

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.480
–&nbsp;... time and chance acting on matter, nothing immaterial,

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.360
they don’t believe in a god who personally governs everything.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.520
When you think about that worldview, how should impact how they walk into the laboratory,

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.400
if they really believe that and lived like it.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.480
–&nbsp;I think a lot of regards they are somewhat foolish for obeying the laws to begin with, 

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.120
because they don’t believe in an ultimate accountability so

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.280
they don’t believe in anything that should resemble consistency in a lab

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.920
and I really don’t understand how they cross that bridge of 

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
not being able to justify the principle of induction and using it every day, so

13
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.000
at the end of the day these these guys like to go home and,

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.080
I don’t know, drink whiskey and smokes cigars or something

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.680
and pretend to not think about the fact that they cannot justify the very science

16
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.720
that they’re using to be their authority on truth. –  Right on!
