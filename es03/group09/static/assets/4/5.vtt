00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
–&nbsp;Why Atheism?

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.200
As a religious person I go through the r/atheism finding nothing but bashing on people like me,

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.600
I'm just trying to figure out you're justifications for being like this.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.160
If anyone can tell me that would be great, thank you.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.880
–&nbsp;Because there is no god.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560
Did anyone set a non-cross on fire in front of your house?

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.240
Did anyone disown you for not believing in their God?

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.480
Did your wife die because a life-saving operation was denied to her

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.240
because the surgery would have been in violation of some atheist dogma?

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.360
Did an atheist threaten you with eternal torture?

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Anything of the sort? No?

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040
Then what the fuck gives you the fucking right to accuse anyone of "bashing" on you,

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.480
you fucking moron?
