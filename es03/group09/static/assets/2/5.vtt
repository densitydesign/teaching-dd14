Straight people are the boiled carrots of humanity,

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.000
and they don’t deserve to be in the same plate as a juicy sirloin steak.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(In this analogy, the juicy steak is the LGBTQ community.)

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
My experiences with all of my former straight friends

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.000
is quite similar to that of TsMadison and Khia’s friendship.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.000
One minute they love us because we’re giving their pathetic livesand

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.600
in Khia’s case,&nbsp;her pathetic career some significance,

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.800
the next minutes soon as they’re angry with us we’re being misgendered and called a bunch of anti-gay, anti-trans slurs.
