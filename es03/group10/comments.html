          <p>There are two main reasons for Malaysians, especially Chinese, to develop overseas: one is to create a better personal career; the other is because the foreign competitive environment is fair and free. <span class="orange">There is no fair competition environment in Malaysia,</span> and it is impossible to create a platform to create a better cause.</p>
          <p><span class="orange">The policy is unfair, the generally low salary and the work environment surrounded by the racial distribution system,</span> forming a high wall.</p>
          <p>These official associations, which have mastered the main economic lifeline of Malaysia, are <span class="orange">influenced by the quota system in the public sphere and still retain the practice of ethnic quota system in personnel promotion.</span></p>

          <p>Although I have <span class="orange">achieved excellent results, I still cannot enter government universities under the quota system </span>and my parents saved money, I went to a private college with a high fee to study a dual-course program.</p>
          <p><span class="orange">This ethnic distribution has a profound impact on society as a whole,</span> resulting in ethnically selected immigrants who are marginalized or unfairly treated.</p>
          <p>The right of <span class="orange">residente issue.</span> I have heard too many foreign companions, especially Chinese ，<span class="orange">they may not get the permanent resident status of Malaysia.</span> But many foreign workers from Indonesia can live in Malaysia for a few years. Permanent residents, even gaining citizenship.</p>

        <div class="four-col">
          <p>Unfair education policies have not improved. In recent years, <span class="orange">many high-level students have complained that they cannot get the government's Public Service Bureau scholarships.</span> These high-school students are almost all Chinese.</p>
          <p><span class="orange">Lack of fair and equal treatment, loss of confidence in domestic development, coupled with the decline in the quality of education and the lack of a free environment for civil society</span> are the root causes of brain drain.</p>
          <p>In addition to unfair policies, <span class="orange">low salaries and social security</span> are also factors that people are reluctant to return to Malaysia.</p>

          <p><span class="orange">The welfare of the Chinese community has been treated differently.</span></p>
          <p>The “quota system" refers to the implementation of a <span class="orange">racial quota system based on the interests of the Malays in education.</span></p>
          <p>The Malaysian authorities also assign professional fields such as medical science, engineering, law, pharmacy and biotechnology to the Malays on the grounds of ethnic policy and 'quota system'. <span class="orange">Chinese outstanding students even though they have achieved remarkable results but they can not enter the ideal university.</span></p>
          
        </div>

        <div class="four-col">
          <p><span class="orange">The quota system of treating Chinese people is unfair. In terms of education,</span> there are restrictions on entering university in Malaysia. If there are 100 degrees, Malays can occupy 70 places regardless of their performance, and 30 places are reserved for Chinese and Indians.</p>
          <p><span class="orange">On the political front, all senior government positions are reserved for the Malays.</span> The authorities also use ethnicity and religion to separate people. On the economic front, business must also retain certain shares to the Malays, which used to be 30%. Now it is 51. %, can only issue a business license.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="four-col">
          <p>The second reason is that the “quota system” imposed by the <span class="orange">Malaysian government requires that college students be admitted according to ethnicity ratio, giving Malays a great deal of preferential treatment,</span> leading Chinese to go abroad to pursue better education, and then work abroad and settle in immigration.</p>
          <p>The third reason is that although <span class="orange">the Malaysian government has cancelled the new economic policy with Malay priority, the Malay priority has a broad social root in Malaysia.</span> These factors have led more and more Chinese to choose expatriate immigrants.</p>
          <p><span class="cream">The birth rate of Chinese is lower than that of other races.</span></p>
