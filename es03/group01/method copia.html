            <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p><b>Hate speech</b> is one of the most important topic in anti-oppression politics today; a great deal of energy and political will is devoted to identifying, characterizing, contesting, and (sometimes) penalizing it.</p>

<p>The inclusion of <b>misogyny</b> in a definition of what constitutes hate speech is generally controversial. Too often sexism is seen as a “second-class” offence, somehow less dangerous than racism or religious hatred. But it is not.</p>

<p>The outbreak of social media provided a new and free-access platform for people to incite violence and to spread patriarchy-enforcing mindset. Though even men can experience this kind of hate, women are more severely attacked and often insulted.
With the online proliferation of hate speech, there is an urgent need to talk about whether someone is using any kind of <b>harmful content</b> that could generate more hate.</p>

<h3 id="the-concept">The concept</h3>

<p>Analyzing the web is easy to find well-organized communities and groups of users against women. The aim of this project is to bring to the attention the opinion of small communities and their vision of female’s activism, using the <b>Antifeminist Manifesto</b> as a flagship worth to be followed.</p>

<p>The website’s strenght is focused on the textual part, that is taken from anti-feminist websites and it’s presented, un-edited, to the users. The fact that this kind of content, hyperbolic and without any logic, is really made by some people, create a sense of dissociation and at the same time gives an unseen perspective on what anti-feminists means. A tree-map visualization can help to better understand where do the contents come from, for each website the treemap visualize the number of characters selected for the text.</p>

<div id="treemap">

</div>

<p>The website speaks mainly to users that don’t know much about <b>feminism</b> or even to the ones that identify themselves as anti-feminist, not understanding the cultural background they are associating themselves to. We also think is important to reach those people who think that <b>equality</b> has been achieved, not considering the importance of feminism and its principles.</p>

<p>The five points of the Manifesto ironically attempt to persuade the visitors to join the Anti-feminist movement, but the desired effect is the complete opposite. The website gradually show the power and the gravity of hate speech, going from the normalized forms of sexism to the most serious and brutal words used to discredit women. Indeed the project aim to <b>bring awareness</b> on this topic and <b>sensitize</b> the visitors, underlining the importance of being feminist in an era where is easy to share harmful and offensive contents.</p>

<h3 id="the-website">The website</h3>

<p>The Anti-Feminist Manifesto was born as part of the Final Synthesis Lab final project at <b>Politecnico di Milano</b>. The Lab, held by <b>Density Design</b> research department, aims to analyze and engage the public about complex and controversial social issues through the analysis of data contents. The website’s elaboration is consequential to the research “Do we still Feminism?”, a project which aim to analyze different aspects of feminism online and to identify the different personalities involved in the discussion.</p>

<p>“The Anti-feminist Manifesto” is entirely designed to create a distorted view of reality. The contents are absurd but, at the same time unique, so their job is to take the user through the path defined by the five statements and create a <b>sense of alienation and astonishment</b>.</p>

<p>Each statement summarize the best of the comments online and it is proposed with the same repeated formula to represents a sort of collection of commandments, rules to define women and their role in the society. The statements represent the main <b>arguments used by anti-feminist public</b>, who reveal themselves misogynists because of such offensive content.</p>

<p>We included text descriptions, which are composed with comments found on the anti-feminist communities; even the visual illustrations and graphics are the result of elaboration of those contents. Going deeply, the alienation effect is much more evident, thanks to the interactive parts whose job is to improve the usability.</p>

<p>A note on language: we recognize and respect that many words are offensive without just context. Those words are just reported to increase the power of the project and sensitize the users, without any other intent.</p>

<h3 id="visitors-of-the-website">Visitors of the website</h3>

<p>In order to track its dissemination potential of the project we created some simple visualization to register some interesting data about the users that visit and share the link. We are able, thanks to this process, to see the resonance of “the AntiFeminist Manifesto” and prove the feasibility of campaigns of this kind.</p>

    <h1><span class="total-users"></span> TOTAL VISITORS from <span class="since">07 FEB</span> untill today</h1>
</div>
<div id="users"></div>

<h3 id="the-campaign">The campaign</h3>

<p>The launching campaign of the project consists in a series of provocative posters in which the pillars of the anti-feminist’s believe are postulated. On the affiche is simply written in large letters: <b>“All women are”</b> followed by a sexist insult.</p>

<p>No further clues are given to the reader whose reaction should be astonishment and disdain. The <b>provocative effect</b> should be maximized by the absence of an explicative payoff and push the reader to follow the link to “The Anti-feminist Manifesto” on the poster.</p>

<p>Once landed on the web-site the user is immersed in a “fun-but-not-really” series of hate-speech comments against women disguised in funny interactive visualizations. Eventually the user discovers the real aim of the project and shares the message through a post on different social media.</p>

<p>We expect people to react in a very emotional way, for this reason we left on the poster a lot of blank space to allow people to write their reactions (and eventually share the poster social media.)</p>
