<h1>Dont' argue with women, bro</h1>

<p>
    How often have you heard a woman’s bitchy behavior be written off as “PMS” or “She must be going through her cycle”. Culturally, it’s called “being a bitch” and refusing to “adult” about your bleeding. Everyone knows you can control it, and actively choose not to. Men just pay the price because you’re a fucking irrational child.
